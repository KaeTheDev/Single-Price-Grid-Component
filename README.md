## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

This project was perfect for practicng flexbox. It was simple enough for me to understand how the basics are applied.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further refine my Flexbox and CSS Grid skills, ensuring that I can efficiently structure layouts with minimal code. Additionally, I'll continue improving my ability to accurately interpret design specs to maintain consistency between the design and the final implementation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - Helped me refine my understanding of Flexbox and how to properly use `gap` spacing.
- [Figma Design Guide](https://www.figma.com/resources/) - Reinforced my ability to read and implement design specifications accurately.
